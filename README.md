My future App
In the near future, I would like to create an application that allows users to journal and to meditate. The application would allow users to write daily journals, read positive affirmations daily, check their progress with the journal and finally to meditate. Users would have a different range of options of meditation to choose from, in addition, they would be able to see their progress with meditation.
